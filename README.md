### Hola, I'm Mathias Brichta ðŸ‘‹

I come from Venezuela and I'm a Front-end Developer based in Vienna, Austria. I've been studying web development and information technology for many years.

I'm a problem solver, well-organized, independent employee with a high attention to detail. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is my favorite hobby, fan of MMA & Football & I love outdoor activities.

Interested in the entire Front-end spectrum and working with positive people
